This file describes the functioning of the program

main.cpp
{
	This contains documentaion for the file main.cpp in src.

	Function list :
	1. main(int argc, char *argv[])
		this is the main function
	2. getOpt(int argc, char *argv[], bool, &print_steps, bool &silent, bool &logical, bool &brute_force)
		this gets the options the user has set 
	3. print*
		these functions print License, help and version when called, to stdout
	
	What the file is for :
		Getting the sudoku, initializing the board and solving the
		sudoku
		It prints the necessary stuff as per user enabled options
	
	How it goes :
		0. getOpt() gets the options to make the program
		   behave accordingly
		1. getSudoku()
			get the sudoku from the user and initaialize
			sudoku.sudoku_q[][]
		2. initialiseSudoku()
			initialise the sudoku possibilities board
		3. print the extra 'pretty stuff' only if the user hasn't
		   set the silent flag. This so that unnecessary stuff is not
		   printed to stdout when scripting
		4. It now starts a timer and tries to solve the sudoku
		5. It now checks if the sudoku hs any mistakes.
		   If there are, then the question must be wrong.
		6. Again, print 'pretty stuff' only if the user hasn't said
		   otherwise
}

Sudoku-solver.h
{
	It contains the structure and list of functions that will be used to
	get the sudoku, print it and solve it
	
	Structures :
		SUDOKU_ANS : This is representative of each individual cell
}
