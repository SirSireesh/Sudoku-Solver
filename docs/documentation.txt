This file describes the functioning of the program

main.cpp
{
	This contains documentaion for the file main.cpp in src.

	Function list :
	1. main(int argc, char *argv[])
		this is the main function
	2. getOpt(int argc, char *argv[], bool, &print_steps, bool &silent, bool &logical, bool &brute_force)
		this gets the options the user has set 
	3. print*
		these functions print License, help and version when called, to stdout
	
	What the file is for :
		Getting the sudoku, initializing the board and solving the
		sudoku
		It prints the necessary stuff as per user enabled options
	
	How it goes :
		0. getOpt() gets the options to make the program
		   behave accordingly
		1. getSudoku()
			get the sudoku from the user and initaialize
			sudoku.sudoku_q[][]
		2. initialiseSudoku()
			initialise the sudoku possibilities board
		3. print the extra 'pretty stuff' only if the user hasn't
		   set the silent flag. This so that unnecessary stuff is not
		   printed to stdout when scripting
		4. It now starts a timer and tries to solve the sudoku
		5. It now checks if the sudoku hs any mistakes.
		   If there are, then the question must be wrong.
		6. Again, print 'pretty stuff' only if the user hasn't said
		   otherwise
}

Sudoku-solver.h
{
	It contains the structure and list of functions that will be used to
	get the sudoku, print it and solve it
	
	Structures :
		SUDOKU_CELL : This is representative of each individual cell
		SUDOKU_ANS_BOARD : This is the 9x9 array of the cells
		SUDOKU : This is the structure that contains the question,
			answer, list of possiblities, number of cells solved,
			rating of the sudoku, and status of the sudoku (if the
			sudoku was changed in the last attempt to solve it)
		POINT : This is a structure to represent points
			NOTE : This structure has not been used everywhere
			because more often than not, it makes code ugly, and
			forces the creation of unnecessary 'temp' variables
	
	Functions :
		getSudoku() : get the sudoku from stdin
		initializeSudoku() : initialize the possiblities board
		printSudoku() : print the sudoku to stdout, unformatted, in a
				single line. usefull for scripting slving of multiple sudokus
		disablePos() : disable a numeber from the sudoku possibiliities
			       board
		disableRow() : same as above, but for the entire row - uses
				disablePos to do th dirty work
		disableColumn() : same as above but for entire column - uses
				disablePos() to do the dirty work
		finalize() : declare a number to be solution to a cell
				-disables all number in the cell on the
				 possiblities board
				-sets the number on the answer board
				-sets the status to changed
		checkError() : checks for any error in the solution
				It checks if th epossiblities board has any
				cells which have zero numbers possible and
				havn't already been solved. If there are any,
				something went wrong
		numCommon() : Gives the number of common numbers between two
			      cells
		getCommon() : Gives the first common number between 2 cells
		numPossible() : Gives the number of numbers possible in a given
				cell
		leastNumsPos() : Return the position of the cell that has the least number of
				possiblities
				Useful for the bruteForce() algorithm

		The rest of the function names are self explanatory. 
		They are the functions that will actually solve the sudoku
